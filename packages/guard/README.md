# guard/ — loop-hygiene guard family

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

The `guard/` group keeps the agent loop productive by watching for common failure patterns. `repeat-tool-reminder` breaks identical tool-call loops with advice. `timeout-policy` gives a hung tool call a clear timed-out error instead of stalling the session. `max-tokens-recovery` answers a turn that spends its whole output ceiling on reasoning with one bounded recovery prompt, so the agent does not stop silently. All ship enabled in the `dsh` base bundle; a composition can tune or remove them.

## Packages

Small, independent plugins cover one pattern each; every README below explains when to keep, tune, or remove it.

| Package | What it provides |
|---|---|
| [`repeat-tool-reminder/`](repeat-tool-reminder/README.md) | Reminds the model when it repeats the same tool call, so it changes approach or finishes |
| [`timeout-policy/`](timeout-policy/README.md) | Times out tool calls that declare a limit, so the model gets a clear error instead of waiting forever |
| [`max-tokens-recovery/`](max-tokens-recovery/README.md) | Queues one bounded recovery prompt when a turn burns its whole output ceiling on reasoning |
