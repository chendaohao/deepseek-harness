/**
 * Answering "which models can this provider serve?" for the configuration
 * surface's "fetch available models" action.
 *
 * A route the installed pi-ai catalog ships is answered **from that catalog**,
 * with no network call at all: pi-ai's registry is the authoritative list for
 * its own providers, and it carries the capacities a listing endpoint would
 * not disclose. Only a route the catalog does not describe — a gateway, a
 * self-hosted server — is interrogated over the wire.
 *
 * Neither path is a catalog refresh. Nothing here is stored: the request
 * carries a draft the user is still editing, and the reply is candidate
 * metadata the surface offers for adoption. `settings.yaml` remains the only
 * thing that decides what a route serves.
 *
 * Only protocols with a readable listing are interrogated: the OpenAI-compatible
 * `GET /models` shape with bearer auth — the one a gateway, a self-hosted
 * server, and the official endpoints all agree on — and the Anthropic Messages
 * listing, which speaks the same path with `x-api-key` and version headers.
 * Every other protocol reports that it cannot be interrogated so the surface
 * falls back to hand-entry rather than guessing a response shape.
